A really simple theme for Home Assistant... no borders, nothing, just pure black!


Not sure how much more I can say about it, but here's a few basic examples to give you some context.

## Installation

<br>

### With HACS (recommended)

(If you're not yet using the [Home Assistant Community Store (HACS)](https://hacs.xyz/), then do that first and come back here.)

- Open HACS from within Home Assistant
- Search for "Blackout" or even "Loryan"
- Click on "Blackout Theme"
- Click "Download"

<br>

### Without HACS

Download the **blackout.yaml** file from the themes folder in this repository and copy it to _your_ themes folder in Home Assistant.

### After either installation method

Regardless of installation method chosen you will need to refresh your browser.

That's it, you're ready to use it!

Just select it as the view theme, and enjoy the awesomeness.
