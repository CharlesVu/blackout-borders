## HACS installation

The first step is to add this repository into your Home Assistant via HACS, which you can do via the handy button below.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=loryanstrant&repository=blackout&category=theme)

The second step is to refresh your browser.

That's it, you're ready to use it!

Just select it as the view theme, and enjoy the awesomeness.
